<h1 align="center">🌐 API Projects using Python</h1>

<p align="center">
  <b>A collection of API projects demonstrating API integration, data fetching, and processing using Python.</b><br/>
  This repository showcases my journey into working with APIs and handling real-world data programmatically.
</p>

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains multiple **API-based projects** performed using Python. Each project demonstrates how to fetch data from public APIs, process it, and present it in a structured format using `requests` and other Python libraries.  

Key tasks performed include:

- Making GET and POST requests to APIs  
- Handling API responses and parsing JSON  
- Extracting, cleaning, and transforming data  
- Saving API data to CSV/JSON  
- Error handling and managing missing or unexpected data

## 🔧 Analysis Tasks Performed

- ✅ Connected to various public APIs using `requests`  
- ✅ Parsed JSON responses into Python data structures  
- ✅ Handled missing or inconsistent API data  
- ✅ Saved outputs in CSV or JSON for later analysis  
- ✅ Implemented loops for multiple API requests (pagination, batch requests)  
- ✅ Documented each project clearly with comments

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/api_projects.git
cd api_projects
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Run a Project
```bash
python file_name.py
```
## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python 3.x

- requests for API calls

- pandas & json for data processing

- Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts

## 🧠 Learnings

- How to authenticate and interact with public APIs

- Parsing and handling JSON data efficiently

- Data cleaning and storage for further use

- Error handling for API failures or missing data

- Building mini-projects for practical coding experience

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add more API projects (Finance, Sports, Music, Social Media APIs)

- Automate API calls and scheduling using Python scripts

- Integrate APIs with visualization dashboards using Plotly/Streamlit

- Handle API rate limits and pagination more effectively
